# MediaQueryProject

This is my first responsive project.
In order to understand the Media Queries concept, I have created this project.
Applied CSS for two screen type, One is for laptop/desktop and other is for Mobile.
I have also added animation and hover operation to make it more beautiful and interesting.
I've found it interesting to create a website which is about anime which i liked.
Comments have been added if you find it difficult to understand the css properties and its purpose.
