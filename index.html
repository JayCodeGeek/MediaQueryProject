              Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day.
              Raised together as children, they came to know of the "Wizard
              King"—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and
              promised that they would compete against each other for the
              position of the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up, the
              stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able
              to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use
              magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by
              training physically. When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is
              bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while
              Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a
              person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's
              Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though
              without hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to
              continue when he hears Yuno's voice. Unleashing his inner emotions
              in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "Black
              Clover" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days
              later, the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the
              same goal—to become the Wizard King!

              Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the
              family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though living
              impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to
              enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou
              decides to go down to the local village to make a little money
              selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou
              to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of
              the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at
              night. When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met
              with a horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered.
              Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been
              turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred,
              Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his only
              remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling
              themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it
              takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants of his beloved
              sister's humanity.

              A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they
              see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a
              notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the
              shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use
              a Death Note, drops one into the human realm. High school student
              and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he
              deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by
              writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies
              immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is
              greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power
              that has fallen into his hands could be. With this divine
              capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to
              build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship
              him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a serial
              killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend
              the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the
              assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and
              eccentric man known only by the name of L.

              Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler—until his family is
              attacked by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human
              souls. It is then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki,
              who gets injured while protecting Ichigo's family from the
              assailant. To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of
              taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result. However,
              as Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given the
              daunting task of hunting down the Hollows that plague their town.
              However, he is not alone in his fight, as he is later joined by
              his friends—classmates Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and Uryuu

              Seven years after the events of Dragon Ball Z, Earth is at peace,
              and its people live free from any dangers lurking in the universe.
              However, this peace is short-lived; a sleeping evil awakens in the
              dark reaches of the galaxy: Beerus, the ruthless God of
              Destruction. Disturbed by a prophecy that he will be defeated by a
              "Super Saiyan God," Beerus and his angelic attendant Whis start
              searching the universe for this mysterious being. Before long,
              they reach Earth where they encounter SON-Goku, one of the
              planet's mightiest warriors, and his similarly powerful friends.

              Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most
              infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and
              execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change
              throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the
              existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was
              this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men
              who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited
              amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory
              and the title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy, a
              17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate.
              Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless
              pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a
              pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure
              that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised
              treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy
              and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy
              adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies,
              all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

              The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has
              been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of
              humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of
              elements to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world
              completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.
              Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted
              nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him
              admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it
              seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the
              number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's
              quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen
              Izuku to be his successor! Enduring many months of grueling
              training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school
              famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's
              freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented
              classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization,
              Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.

              Grotesque, Godzilla-like monsters called "kaijuu" have been
              appearing around Japan for many years. To combat these beasts, an
              elite military unit known as the Defense Corps risks their lives
              daily to protect civilians. Once a creature is killed,
              "sweepers"—working under the Professional Kaijuu Cleaner
              Corporation—are left to dispose of its remains. Kafka Hibino, a
              32-year-old man, is unsatisfied with his job as a sweeper. From a
              young age, he has aspired to join the Defense Corps and kill
              kaijuus for a living. After a few failed attempts, however, he
              gave up on his dreams and resigned himself to the mediocrity that
              provided a decent paycheck. Nevertheless, when an ambitious,
              18-year-old recruit named Leno Ichikawa joins his cleaning team,
              Kafka is once again reminded of his desire to join the military.
              Following a chain of unfortunate events and an interaction with
              the junior sweeper, Kafka encounters a parasite-type kaijuu that
              forces its way in through his mouth—turning him into a humanoid
              monster. With his newfound powers, Kafka aims to give his lifelong
              dream a final try.

              Ryoumen, the "King of Curses." Yuuji experiences first-hand the
              threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own
              newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu
              Technical High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he
              cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.

              Denji is robbed of a normal teenage life, left with nothing but
              his deadbeat father's overwhelming debt. His only companion is his
              pet, the chainsaw devil Pochita, with whom he slays devils for
              money that inevitably ends up in the yakuza's pockets. All Denji
              can do is dream of a good, simple life: one with delicious food
              and a beautiful girlfriend by his side. But an act of greedy
              betrayal by the yakuza leads to Denji's brutal, untimely death,
              crushing all hope of him ever achieving happiness. Remarkably, an
              old contract allows Pochita to merge with the deceased Denji and
              bestow devil powers on him, changing him into a hybrid able to
              transform his body parts into chainsaws. Because Denji's new
              abilities pose a significant risk to society, the Public Safety
              Bureau's elite devil hunter Makima takes him in, letting him live
              as long as he obeys her command. Guided by the promise of a
              content life alongside an attractive woman, Denji devotes
              everything and fights with all his might to make his naive dreams
              a reality.
